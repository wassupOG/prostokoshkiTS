# &#128049; Website template for a charity animal shelter üê∂

## Why do it?
I've decited to create this website due to two factors:
1. I want to support the cat shelter I got my two lovely cats from. Of course, they have accounts on social media. However, social media groups don't cover people who aren't registered there. Therefore, people couldn't simply send a link to their parents / grandparets without social media accounts. **Now they can!** Adopting homeless animals and making this world a better place has been made easier ‚úîÔ∏è
2. I've recently started learning React and TypeScript, so I wanted to get some **meaningful** practice and see what the development process is like.

## Can I borrow this template?üßê - Of course you can‚ùó
Feel free to download this template & create a similar website for an animal shelter or something of this kind (you name it). I will regularly deliver updates to this website since I am planning to implement some other features like dark mode, more advanced filters, etc.
